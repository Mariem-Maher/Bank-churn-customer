# **Customer Churn Analysis - Power BI Dashboard**  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to identify patterns and insights that help businesses understand why customers leave. By leveraging **Power BI**, I visualized key metrics and trends to provide actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies.  

## **📊 Dataset & Analysis**  
- **Dataset:** The dataset contains customer information, subscription details, and churn status.  
- **Goal:** Identify churn patterns and analyze factors influencing customer retention.  
- **Key Insights:**  
  ✅ **Having a credit card** impacts churn likelihood.  
  ✅ **Gender differences** play a role in churn behavior.  
  ✅ **Customer tenure (years with the bank)** influences churn rates.  
  ✅ **Account balance** and **monthly salary** are significant churn predictors.  

## **📈 Tools & Technologies Used**  
- **Power BI** (Data visualization & dashboard creation)  
- **Power Query** (Initial data cleaning & processing)
